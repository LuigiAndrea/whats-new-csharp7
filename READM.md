Don't worry if you are not up to speed on the latest C# language features. In this playground I provide a summary of the most relevant features in the latest version of C#. You can tweak the code to test them on your own without the need to create a new project.
Let me know if there are important features that I missed.

Verify your version running dotnet --version in a terminal/console window.

### Build and Run

To __build and run__ the sample, navigate to src and run the following commands:
```
dotnet restore

dotnet run
